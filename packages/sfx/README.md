## Features

- **19 sounds** for hovers, presses, toggles, confirmations, errors, loading, and money moments.
- **Zero files, zero dependencies.** Every sound is a small recipe of oscillators and filtered noise.
- **One node per play.** Each sound is rendered once with an `OfflineAudioContext` and cached. After
  that, a play is a single `AudioBufferSourceNode`, 5–75× cheaper on the main thread than building
  the synth graph each time.
- **A mixed output.** One master bus with volume control and a limiter, so overlapping sounds don't
  clip. Voice stealing and retrigger guards stop sounds from piling up.
- **Declarative binding.** Add `data-sound-*` attributes and call `bind()` once. It uses delegated
  listeners with no MutationObserver, handles keyboard press and release, skips disabled controls,
  and returns an unbind function.
- **Safe everywhere.** Importing is SSR-safe. `play()` never throws, and it waits for the browser's
  first user gesture before touching audio. Audio resumes on its own when the page comes back from the
  background or an iOS interruption.
- **Native and video export.** The `sfx-wav` CLI and `@bloxwap/sfx/wav` render the same sounds to WAV
  files for native apps, and `renderTo()` bakes them into a video soundtrack.
- **Tested.** 100% line, branch, and function coverage, including real offline renders of every sound.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @bloxwap/sfx
```

ESM only. Works in all modern browsers, and is a silent no-op on the server.

## Usage

Declarative: add attributes, then call `bind()` once.

```html
<button data-sound-press data-sound-release>Save</button>
<a href="/docs" data-sound-hover="tick">Docs</a>
<button role="switch" data-sound-toggle>Dark mode</button>
```

```ts
import { bind } from '@bloxwap/sfx';

const unbind = bind(); // the whole document, including elements added later
```

Imperative: play a sound from your own code.

```ts
import { play, preload, setVolume } from '@bloxwap/sfx';

preload(); // optional: render every sound now so the first play is as cheap as the rest
setVolume(0.6);

try {
  await save();
  play('success');
} catch {
  play('error');
}

play('tick', { volume: 0.5, rate: 1.25, pan: -0.3 });

// A tap: release 90 ms after press, scheduled on the audio clock.
play('press');
play('release', { delay: 0.09 });
```

## Attributes

| Attribute            | Plays on                         | Default sound |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `data-sound-hover`   | mouse `pointerenter`             | `chime`       |
| `data-sound-press`   | primary `pointerdown`, Enter/Space down | `press` |
| `data-sound-release` | primary `pointerup`, Enter/Space up     | `release` |
| `data-sound-toggle`  | `click` (including keyboard)     | `toggle`      |

Set the value to a sound name to choose a different sound (`data-sound-hover="tick"`). Hover sounds
play only for a mouse on a fine pointer, at most one every 150 ms. Controls that are disabled,
`aria-disabled="true"`, or `inert` stay silent.

## Sounds

| Sound | Character | Good for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chime` | soft rising two-note bell | default hover |
| `sparkle` | quick four-note twinkle | playful accents |
| `droplet` | single note gliding down | dismiss, collapse |
| `bloom` | warm slow swell | reveal, expand |
| `whisper` | breathy quiet texture | dense lists |
| `tick` | crisp instant tick | navigation hover |
| `press` | dull muted knock | pointer down |
| `release` | bright springy tick | pointer up |
| `toggle` | mechanical click-clack | switches, tabs |
| `success` | warm three-note confirmation | completed actions |
| `error` | soft descending refusal | recoverable errors |
| `page` | papery flick and glass tick | pages, carousels |
| `loading` | brief unresolved rise | work starting |
| `ready` | focus tick and open fifth | content ready |
| `payout` | deep two-stage coin | payouts, rewards |
| `deposit` | wide metallic shimmer | deposits, credits |
| `pluck` | tight falling pluck | pickups, selections |
| `notification` | bright physical bell | messages, activity |
| `loss` | heavy two-stage fall | losses, negative outcomes |

## API

```ts
import {
  play, preload, bind, unlock,
  setEnabled, isEnabled, setVolume, getVolume, configure,
  stopAll, activeVoices, getOutput, dispose,
  renderTo, renderBuffer,
  sounds, isSound, duration,
  type SoundName, type PlayOptions, type BindOptions, type EngineOptions, type RenderOptions,
} from '@bloxwap/sfx';
```

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `play(name = 'chime', options?)` | Plays a sound now. `options`: `volume` (0–2), `rate` (0.25–4), `pan` (-1–1), `delay` (seconds, 0–10), `minInterval` (ms, overrides `configure()`), `force` (skip the user-gesture check). Never throws. |
| `preload(names?)` | Renders sounds (all of them by default) to buffers. Safe to call before any user gesture. |
| `bind(root = document, options?)` | Wires `data-sound-*` attributes under `root`. Returns `unbind()`. Options: `keyboard`, `hoverInterval`. |
| `unlock()` | Creates and resumes audio from inside a gesture. `bind()` calls it on the first press. |
| `setEnabled(on)` / `isEnabled()` | Global mute. Sounds already playing finish; sounds waiting on a suspended context are dropped. |
| `setVolume(0–1)` / `getVolume()` | Master volume, with a short glide to avoid clicks. |
| `configure({ maxVoices, minInterval, resume })` | Voice cap (default 24), per-sound retrigger guard (default 16 ms), and what `play()` does while audio is suspended: `'queue'` (default) or `'eager'`. |
| `stopAll()` / `activeVoices()` | Stops every playing sound / counts them. |
| `getOutput()` | The last node before the speakers, for an `AnalyserNode` or a recorder. |
| `dispose()` | Closes the audio context, removes its page listeners, and clears caches. |
| `renderTo(context, name, options?)` | Schedules a sound onto any `BaseAudioContext`, such as an `OfflineAudioContext`. `options`: `volume`, `rate`, `pan`, `delay`, `destination`. Returns `false` instead of throwing. |
| `renderBuffer(name, { sampleRate }?)` | Renders one sound to a new stereo `AudioBuffer` (3000–768000 Hz). Resolves `null` if it can't. |
| `sounds` / `isSound(value)` / `duration(name)` | The catalog, a type guard, and each sound's length in seconds. |

The raw recipe data is available from `@bloxwap/sfx/recipes`.

With the default `resume: 'queue'`, sounds requested while the audio context is suspended play once it
resumes, and requests older than 250 ms are dropped. `'eager'` schedules them at once for the lowest
latency, at the cost of stacking up during a long suspension. The engine also resumes the context when
the page becomes visible, is shown, or regains focus, as long as it has had a user gesture.

## WAV export and native apps

Render the same sounds to WAV files for iOS, Android, or desktop apps. The CLI needs the optional peer
dependency `node-web-audio-api`:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @bloxwap/sfx node-web-audio-api
npx sfx-wav --out assets/sfx --sounds tick,toggle,success --combo tap=press@0,release@0.09 --trim
```

| Flag | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--out <dir>` | `./sfx` | Output directory |
| `--sounds <a,b,c>` | all | Sounds to render (`""` for only combos) |
| `--sample-rate <hz>` | `48000` | 3000–768000 |
| `--bit-depth <16\|24\|32>` | `16` | 16/24-bit PCM or 32-bit float |
| `--channels <1\|2>` | `2` | Mono is an average of both channels |
| `--trim` | off | Cut the tail below -60 dB, keeping 20 ms |
| `--combo <name=sound@s,...>` | | Mix sounds into one file (repeatable) |

It exits with 0 on success, 1 when rendering or writing fails, and 2 for bad flags.

The encoder is also a separate, dependency-free entry point that works on any `AudioBuffer`:

```ts
import { renderBuffer } from '@bloxwap/sfx';
import { encodeWav, trimSilence } from '@bloxwap/sfx/wav';

// In a browser. In Node, use renderTo() with node-web-audio-api's OfflineAudioContext.
const buffer = await renderBuffer('success', { sampleRate: 44100 });
if (buffer) {
  const wav = encodeWav(trimSilence(buffer), { bitDepth: 24, channels: 1 }); // an ArrayBuffer
  const file = new Blob([wav], { type: 'audio/wav' });
}
```

`encodeWav(buffer, { bitDepth: 16 | 24 | 32, channels: 1 | 2 })` throws a `RangeError` for an invalid
format. `trimSilence(buffer, { thresholdDb = -60, padMs = 20 })` cuts the tail relative to the peak.

baking sounds into a video soundtrack.
